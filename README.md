A dataset for ice segmentation
## Overview
The Yellow River is the main birthplace of Chinese civilization. The Yellow River spans a large latitude range, and ice flood is easy to occur in the upstream and downstream (Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi and Shandong). From 1987 to 2015, there were 67 ice flood disasters. The management and governance of the Yellow River involves many fields, such as flood control and disaster relief, water conservancy management, soil and water conservation, embankment safety and disease prevention, water conservancy informatization and so on. Therefore, the prevention of the Yellow River disaster is very important.
